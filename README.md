# Features

_üèÜ Runner up in the Obsidian Gems of the Year 2024: New plugins category._

- [Create toolbars](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Creating-toolbars) with items that link to commands, files/folders, URIs/URLs, menus, and [scripts](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Executing-scripts) (Dataview, JS Engine, Templater, and built-in support for JavaScript).
  - Built-in [Gallery of 100+ items](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Gallery) that can be added to your toolbars in just a couple clicks/taps.
- [Define where and how toolbars are displayed](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Defining-where-to-show-toolbars): Based on their folders, or a user-defined property.
  - [Position each toolbar](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Positioning-toolbars) below the Properties section, at the top or bottom of notes, or as a floating button.
  - Add a toolbar to the _New tab_ view, or [completely replace the New tab view](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/New-tab-view) as a launchpad for your vault.
  - Access the toolbar from the navigation bar (on mobile).
- Use Obsidian's built-in icons, labels (which can include emojis), or a mix of both.
  - Set optional tooltips for each item.
  - Show items specifically on mobile, desktop, or both.
  - Choose whether the icon, label, or both are displayed.
- Use [variables](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Variables) or script experssions to sub in the note's title or properties and more into toolbar item labels, tooltips, and URIs.
- [Note Toolbar Callouts](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Note-Toolbar-Callouts) let you create and place toolbars anywhere within your notes.
- [Share toolbars](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Sharing-toolbars) with other users with a link, or [as callouts](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Creating-callouts-from-toolbars).
- [Style toolbars](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Styling-toolbars) by adding borders, sticking to the top of your note on scroll, auto-hiding, choosing whether or not the toolbar should wrap (on mobile), making items look like buttons or act like tabs, and aligning items (left, right, centered, evenly spaced).
  - Change or override these styles on mobile (i.e, phone and tablet).
  - Use any icon for the floating button or [nav bar](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Navigation-bar) (on mobile).
  - Or use the [Style Settings plugin](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Style-Settings-plugin-support) for even more options (colors, positioning, sizing, etc.).
- Add [commands](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Commands) to open any toolbar, or to execute any item. Built-in commands _completely_ hide note properties, quickly access toolbars with [Quick Tools](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Quick-Tools), get command URIs, and more.
- [Note Toolbar URIs](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Note-Toolbar-URIs) let you execute commands, focus on folders, open menus (within Note Toolbar Callouts), and open toolbar settings, from mostly anywhere within your notes.
- [Keyboard controls](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Accessibility) available via the _Note Toolbar: Focus_ command
- Right-click toolbars to swap with other toolbars, quickly change the position, style, or to access configuration.
- The [Note Toolbar API](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Note-Toolbar-API) provides toolbar access, and the ability to show UI (suggesters, prompts, menus, and modals). The latter enables Dataview JS, JS Engine, or Templater scripts to ask for information, or to show helpful text.

# Getting Started üöÄ

Once enabled, open Note Toolbar's settings:

1. Create a _+ New toolbar_
2. Give the toolbar a _name_.
3. _+ Add_ (or search the [Gallery](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Gallery))
4. Exit settings, and _open a note_.
5. Add a `notetoolbar` property. Set it to the name of your toolbar.

If you want your toolbar to show _without_ using a property, try mapping a folder (like wherever your Daily Notes are stored) to your new toolbar.
