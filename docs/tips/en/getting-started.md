Thank you for installing Note Toolbar!

This plugin provides a flexible way to create context-aware toolbars for your notes, which can include commands, file and folder links, websites/URIs, menus, and scripts (Dataview, Templater, and JavaScript).

With this plugin, you also get Note Toolbar Callouts which you can add anywhere in your notes.

## Add your first toolbar

1. Open Settings and click the *Gallery* button/link.
2. Select an item to create your first toolbar.
  - If you use Daily Notes, add a navigation toolbar between those notes.

## To get a toolbar to show up in your notes

You only have to do this once for each new toolbar:

* in Note Toolbar's settings, under Folder Mappings, map your Daily Notes folder to your new toolbar; OR
* in your daily notes template, add a `notetoolbar` property with the name of your new toolbar.
