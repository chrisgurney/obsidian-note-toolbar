Thank you for installing Note Toolbar!

## Add your first toolbar

1. Open Settings and click the *Gallery* button/link.
2. Select an item. A new toolbar will be created (otherwise you would be prompted to select one).

Try: For example, if you use the Daily Notes core plugin, create a toolbar that navigates between them:

> [!note-toolbar-gallery]
> - daily-notes-prev
> - daily-notes-today
> - daily-notes-next

Or create your own items. Other item types let you use commands, file and folder links, websites/URIs, menus, and scripts (Dataview, Templater, and JavaScript).

## To get a toolbar to show up in your notes

You only have to do this once for each new toolbar:

* in Note Toolbar's settings, under Folder Mappings, map your Daily Notes folder to your new toolbar; OR
* in your daily notes template, add a `notetoolbar` property with the name of your new toolbar.
