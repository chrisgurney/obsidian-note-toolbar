## Navigation between notes

After enabling the Daily Notes core plugin, add *Previous daily note*, *Next daily note*, and *Today's daily note* items. 

The beauty of using these commands is that it navigates to the next or previous _existing_ note, which is perfect if you skip days. 

``` [!note-toolbar-gallery]
- daily-notes-prev
- daily-notes-today
- daily-notes-next
```

Consider using the Periodic Notes plugin for weekly, monthly, and annual notes.

If you use a more advanced structure, you can add a URI item with expressions for Dataview, Templater, etc. to create your links.

EXAMPLE

## Add links to other important notes

Other items that might be helpful in your daily notes toolbar:

- Link to a Home note so you can get around your vault.
- Open a note in a new tab.
- Pin your daily note so you can easily return to it throughout the day.
