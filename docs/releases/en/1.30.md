# What's new in Note Toolbar v1.30?

_Make sure you've updated to the latest version to get all of these changes._

## New Features 🎉

### Hide the top navigation (on phones)

- Choose whether Obsidian's top navigation (view heading) is shown.
  - Actions cannot be individually hidden, but if there's enough demand for this I will consider adding this feature.
- Settings for customizing navigation bars, including the ribbon button, has been moved to the **Navigation bars** section (only visible on phones).
- _Thanks to @Xto-tT0 for [the suggestion](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/502)._

## Improvements 🚀

- Settings: Main settings that are not applicable to the current platform are no longer shown (e.g., phone settings not applicable to desktop are not shown on desktop, and vice-versa).

## Fixes 🛠️

- Fixed the fade effect under `Top (fixed)` position toolbars to not cover the note heading.
