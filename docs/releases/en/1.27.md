What's new in Note Toolbar v1.27?

_Make sure you've updated to the latest version to get all of these changes._

## New Features 🎉

### Support for Obsidian 1.11

Obsidian 1.11 comes with an overhauled mobile UI and settings experience. This update of Note Toolbar:
- repositions toolbars to avoid conflicts with the header and navigation bars, on phones; and
- updates the Settings UI to support the new Obsidian 1.11 settings UI elements.

_Give it a try and [let me know what you think](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/447)! (Use this [Google form ↗](https://forms.gle/sa75KNAQiWTtAY4P8) if you don't have a GitHub account.)_

> [!NOTE]
> When using themes with Note Toolbar, particularly on mobile, it may take some time to work out issues. Themes may need to be updated for 1.11, and then Note Toolbar may need to be updated to adjust for those updates. Please report any issues you find.

### Obsidian Navbar item visibility

Hide items in Obsidian's mobile navigation bar. Select them individually via **Other → Navbar item visibility**.

- This provides more room for floating buttons, particularly on smaller phone screens.
- Reduces redundancy if toolbar items replicate (or enhance upon) navigation bar actions.

## Improvements 🚀

### Display Editor menu as a toolbar

If a toolbar is selected for the **Toolbars within the app → Editor menu** setting, you can now choose to either display the toolbar as a menu (default), or as a toolbar. If enabled, the toolbar uses the styles configured for that toolbar.

### Other improvements

- Japanese translations have been added thanks to @dai!
- Text toolbars: Now reposition as the editor scrolls, instead of vanishing. _Thanks for [the suggestion](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/444) @moyf!_
- Gallery: Added: `Toggle keyboard`, `Set heading 1-6`, `Search for selection`, `File switcher`, `Tab switcher`
- Gallery: `Jump to top` and `Jump to bottom` now also work in Reading/Preview mode. To get the improved versions, re-add these items to your toolbars from the Gallery. _Thanks @DZL1943 for [the improvement](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/412#discussioncomment-15345915)!_
- Gallery: Headings are now sorted alphabetically, so it's easier to find what you're after in other supported languages. 
- Item settings: Increased the default size of textareas, to help with scripting.
- Tablets: Item menu titles (that showed the toolbar's name) are no longer added. Now they only appear on phones.

## Fixes 🛠️

- The gap between the properties section and note body was previously removed, even if there was no note. [#442](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/442) _Thank you @cameronsjo_
- New tab view: Launchpad was not rendered correctly if toolbar is in non-props or non-floating-button positions.
- `Focus` command: Stopped working in `v1.26` for toolbars other than text toolbars. It should now be working again. [#448](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/448) _Thank you @FelipeRearden!_
- What's New notes: When using a non-English language, an error was being displayed (because it was not properly failing over to English).
- Internally, the text toolbar extension is now only registered if it's configured. This is a potential fix for [#451](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/451).

## API

### `ntb.menu()` Improvements

Instead of individually creating items for your menus, you can provide the name or ID of an existing toolbar:

```js
await ntb.menu('Daily Notes');
```

Menus by default appear next to the toolbar item that triggered it. However, since you can [execute toolbar items from commands](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Creating-toolbar-items#more-actions), it might be useful to open menus in other locations, such as at the cursor: 

```js
// opens the menu next to the editor cursor
await ntb.menu('Daily Notes', { position: 'cursor' });
```

[See the documentation.](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Note-Toolbar-API#menu)
