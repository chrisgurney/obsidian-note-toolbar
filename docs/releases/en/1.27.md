What's new in Note Toolbar v1.27?

_Make sure you've updated to the latest version to get all of these changes._

## New Features 🎉

### Support for Obsidian 1.11

Obsidian 1.11 comes with an overhauled mobile UI and settings experience. This update of Note Toolbar:
- repositions toolbars to avoid conflicts with the header and navigation bars, on phones; and
- updates the Settings UI to support the new Obsidian 1.11 settings UI elements.

### Display Editor menu as a toolbar

If a toolbar is selected for the **Toolbars within the app → Editor menu** setting, you can now choose to either display the toolbar as a menu (default), or as a toolbar. If enabled, the toolbar uses the styles configured for that toolbar.

## Fixes 🛠️

- The gap between the properties section and note body was previously removed, even if there was no note. [#442](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/442) _Thank you @cameronsjo_
