### Support for Obsidian 1.11

Obsidian 1.11 comes with an overhauled mobile UI and settings experience. This update of Note Toolbar:
- repositions toolbars to avoid conflicts with the header and navigation bars, on phones; and
- updates the Settings UI to support the new Obsidian 1.11 settings UI elements.

_Give it a try and [let me know what you think](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/447)! (Use this [Google form ↗](https://forms.gle/sa75KNAQiWTtAY4P8) if you don't have a GitHub account.)_

#### Known issues
- [ ] when the phone's keyboard is showing, floating buttons are not accessible
- [ ] when the phone's keyboard is showing, the bottom toolbar jumps up

> [!NOTE]
> When using themes with Note Toolbar, particularly on mobile, it may take some time to work out issues. Themes may need to be updated for 1.11, and then Note Toolbar may need to be updated to adjust for those updates. Please report any issues you find.

### Display Editor menu as a toolbar

If a toolbar is selected for the **Toolbars within the app → Editor menu** setting, you can now choose to either display the toolbar as a menu (default), or as a toolbar. If enabled, the toolbar uses the styles configured for that toolbar.

## Improvements 🚀

- The text toolbar now repositions as the editor scrolls, instead of disappearing. _Thanks for [the suggestion](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/444) @moyf!_

## Fixes 🛠️

- The gap between the properties section and note body was previously removed, even if there was no note. [#442](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/442) _Thank you @cameronsjo_
- The `Focus` command should now be working again. [#448](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/448) _Thank you @FelipeRearden!_
