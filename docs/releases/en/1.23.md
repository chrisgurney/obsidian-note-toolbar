What's new in Note Toolbar v1.23?

## New Features üéâ

### Set focus in editor after executing commands

Command items now have an option that lets you set the focus in the editor after running the command. On mobile, this keeps the keyboard visible. (Open the setting by clicking the ‚öôÔ∏è gear icon.)

Several items in the Gallery (e.g., formatting commands such as _Toggle bold_, _Toggle italics_, etc.) have been updated to use this feature. You will have to re-add them if you're already using them, or enable the above setting.

### Load settings on change

If your plugin's settings are being synced across devices, enable the **Load settings changes** option to load Note Toolbar's settings as soon as they change.

- If this option is not enabled (default), Obsidian needs to be restarted to pick up changes to settings made on other devices. 
- Toolbars should be updated when syncing has completed on the target device.
- This setting is stored on each device (in local storage). If syncing updates appears to have stopped, review this setting and enable it again if necessary.

## Improvements üöÄ

- After running the [_Toggle Properties_ or _Hide Properties_ command](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Commands#properties-helpers), hidden properties now _stay_ hidden across all notes and tabs. [#154](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/154) _Thanks @moyf!_
- Advanced settings for Command, File, and URI item types are now hidden under a toggle (‚öôÔ∏è gear icon).
- Settings: The _New toolbar_ button is now below the collapsible container, for easier access when there's a long list of toolbars.

## Fixes

- Settings: Tablet: Toolbar list collapse was not working (search field was being hidden).
- Settings: Phone: In the toolbar modal, reduced space above the toolbar's Name field.
