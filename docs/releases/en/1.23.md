What's new in Note Toolbar v1.23?

## New Features 🎉

### Set focus in editor after executing commands

Command items now have an option that lets you set the focus in the editor after running the command. On mobile, this keeps the keyboard visible. (Open the setting by clicking the ⚙️ gear icon.)

Several items in the Gallery (e.g., formatting commands such as **Toggle bold**, **Toggle italics**, etc.) have been updated to use this feature. You will have to re-add them if you're already using them, or enable the above setting.

### Load settings on change

If plugin settings are being synced across devices, enable the **Load settings changes** setting to load Note Toolbar's settings as soon as they change. If this setting is not enabled (default), Obsidian needs to be restarted to pick up changes made on other devices. 

## Improvements 🚀

Advanced settings for Command, File, and URI item types are now hidden under a toggle (⚙️ gear icon).

## Fixes

- Settings: Phone: In the toolbar modal, reduced space above the toolbar's Name field.
