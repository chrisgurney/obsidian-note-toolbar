What's new in Note Toolbar v1.23?

## New Features üéâ

### Set focus in editor after executing commands

Command items now have the option to set the focus in the editor after running the command. On mobile, this keeps the keyboard visible. (Open the setting by clicking the ‚öôÔ∏è gear icon.)

Several items in the Gallery (e.g., formatting commands such as _Toggle bold_, _Toggle italics_, etc.) have been updated to use this feature. You will have to re-add these items if you're already using them, or enable the above setting for each item.

### REMOVED: Load settings on change

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I've removed the `Load settings on change` setting (hopefully temporarily) due to potentially causing plugin data loss, even if you weren't using this setting. See [#340](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/340). _Please comment on this issue if you've experienced anything similar._

~~If your plugin's settings are being synced across devices, enable the **Load settings changes** option to load Note Toolbar's settings as soon as they change.~~

~~- If this option is not enabled (default), Obsidian needs to be restarted to pick up changes to settings made on other devices.~~
~~- Toolbars should be updated when syncing has completed on the target device.~~
~~- This setting is stored on each device (in local storage). If syncing updates appears to have stopped, review this setting and enable it again if necessary.~~

### External links can be opened in other views (desktop only)

URIs that are external links (web page URLs) can now be opened in new tabs, split views, or in a new window, assuming [Obsidian's Web Viewer ‚Üó](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/web-viewer) is enabled. Modifier keys are now also supported.

- If Web Viewer is not enabled (or on mobile where it's not available), the link will open in the system's default browser (outside of Obsidian).
- If Web Viewer is enabled and _not_ set to _Open external links_, Note Toolbar will still use it for the non-default view types.
- Modal window width can be adjusted (on desktop) via [Style Settings](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Style-Settings-plugin-support/).

## Improvements üöÄ

### New setting: Keep properties state

This new setting maintains the visibility state of Properties in notes, if you use Note Toolbar's options to toggle properties. If enabled, you will have to use Note Toolbar's "Show note properties" right-click option or command to show properties again. This setting is disabled by default.

### Other improvements

- When right-clicking on menu items in a toolbar, a new option **Edit menu toolbar** takes you straight to that toolbar's configuration.
- The toolbar notification is no longer shown if the Note Toolbar property being changed is set to `tags`. _Thanks to /u/SeaGiraffe4728 on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1kjz6am/note_toolbar_gallery_and_more_updates/)_
- Advanced settings for Command, File, and URI item types are now hidden under a toggle (‚öôÔ∏è gear icon).
- Settings: The _New toolbar_ button is now below the collapsible toolbar section, for easier access when there's a long list of toolbars.
- Settings: Reorganized the Item options menu, to better group items on phones.
- The Help window is now a view, for better navigation to other views (such as the Gallery), and to prepare for the future addition of helpful content.
- Ukrainian localization updated by @laktiv in [#321](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/pull/321) [#334](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/pull/334)
- Chinese localization updated by @Moyf in [#331](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/pull/331)

## Gallery

Added:

- **New drawing** ‚Üí Creates a new Excalidraw drawing (in a new tab).
- **Copy note content** ‚Üí Copies the body of the current note to the clipboard, ignoring frontmatter.

## Fixes

- Menus: Empty items (i.e., items with no icon, label, and tooltip) are no longer displayed.
- Menus: Hotkeys were displaying underneath text; they now appear to the right.
- On switching to source view, the styled properties section was still being shown; it should now be hidden. [#338](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/338) _Thanks @Moyf_
- Most recent opened file was not at the top of file suggesters.
- The default tab border style was shifting toolbar lines up; it's been replaced with an inset box shadow.
- Language code may not be initialized when loading remote content (such as the _What's New_ notes) preventing it from being displayed.
- Settings: Phone: _Folder mappings_ heading text was not full width when there was no collapse button showing.
- Settings: Tablet: Toolbar list collapse was not working (search field was being hidden).
- Settings: Phone: In the toolbar modal, reduced unneeded space above the toolbar's _Name_ field.

## API

Adds a `ntb.setProperty()` method, which lets you update frontmatter easily from any script. [See the documentation.](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Note-Toolbar-API#setproperty)

Examples:

```ts
await ntb.setProperty('Created', moment().format('YYYY-MM-DD'));
await ntb.setProperty('cssclasses', 'myclass');
await ntb.setProperty('A Link', '[[Some Note]]');
await ntb.setProperty('A Number', 1234);
await ntb.setProperty('A List', ['asdf', 'asdf2']);
```
