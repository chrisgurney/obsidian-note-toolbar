What's new in Note Toolbar v1.24?

## New Features ðŸŽ‰

### Launchpad BETA

The [Launchpad](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Launchpad) is an experimental feature to show a toolbar as a replacement for the _New tab_ view. It's actually live right now in `1.23.05` or later, because I need your feedback!

Try it out:

1. Go to **File types and views â†’ New tab view** and select a toolbar that will only be used for the New tab view.
2. Open a New tab view, to confirm the toolbar you selected is displayed.
3. Open the settings for the toolbar, and type in this **Custom style**: `note-toolbar-launchpad`

Please [read this page](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Launchpad) and [let me know your feedback](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/341)!

### Toolbars in Bases

Adds toolbars to [Bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases), "a new core plugin that lets you turn any set of notes into a powerful database. With Bases you can organize everything from projects to travel plans, reading lists, and more."

Enable under **File types and views â†’ Bases**.

> [!note]
> This option may change depending on how this Catalyst feature evolves. 

### Toolbars for other data types

Enable under **File types and views â†’ Other data types**. Type in the name of a data type (e.g., `excalidraw`).

- This is _not_ the same as the file's extension. (e.g., Excalidraw files have a `.md` file extension.)
- This uses the **data type**, which can be found by:
  - inspecting the editor when you have a file open, and
  - searching for the `data-type` attribute.
- Let me know if you need help trying to figure this out for a given plugin or file type. 
- _Thank you for the suggestion @BlitzVI_ via [#314](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/314).

| For this plugin/view... | ...enter this data type |
| --- | --- |
| Excalidraw | `excalidraw` |
| Graph view | `graph` (Uses the _New tab view_ toolbar, if one is configured.) |

### COMING SOON: Tips

Articles built into Note Toolbar's Help about getting started with Note Toolbar, adding daily notes navigation, tips for mobile, and more!

## Improvements ðŸš€

- Search results for toolbars and toolbar items now prioritize results that start with the given search string. _Thank you for the suggestion @dopairym_ via [#266](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/266).
- Gallery: Items now use a little bit of color, and show a plus icon on hover.

## Fixes

- Help: The title now appears in light mode.
- What's New (release notes): The language code was not being displayed in the content of fetch error messages; it displayed the wrong URL.
