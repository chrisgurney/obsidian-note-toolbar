What's new in Note Toolbar v1.24?

## New Features üéâ

### Replace the New tab view with a toolbar

Under the **New tab view** section in settings, select a toolbar and enable **Replace view with toolbar**.

The [Launchpad](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/New-tab-view) lets you show a toolbar as a replacement for the _New tab_ view.

#### Try it out

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If you've previously tried the Launchpad beta, remove the `note-toolbar-launchpad` custom class from your toolbar.

1. In Note Toolbar's settings, go to **New tab view** and select **New tab toolbar**.
2. Enable the **Replace view with toolbar** setting.

Look for the _New tab view (Launchpad)_ in the Style Settings plugin to customize color, columns, sizing, and more.

Please [read this page](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/New-tab-view) and [let me know your feedback](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/341)!

### Toolbars in Bases

Show your toolbars in [Bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases), "a new core plugin that lets you turn any set of notes into a powerful database."

Enable under **File types and views ‚Üí Bases**.

> [!note]
> This option may change depending on how this Catalyst feature evolves. 

### Toolbars in other file types

Enable under **File types and views ‚Üí Other data types**. Type in the name of a data type (e.g., `excalidraw`).

- This is _not_ the same as the file's extension. (e.g., Excalidraw files have a `.md` file extension.)
- This uses the **data type**, which can be found by:
  - inspecting the editor when you have a file open, and
  - searching for the `data-type` attribute.
- Let me know if you need help trying to figure this out for a given plugin or file type. 
- _Thank you for the suggestion @BlitzVI_ via [#314](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/314).

| For this plugin/view... | ...enter this data type |
| --- | --- |
| Excalidraw | `excalidraw` |
| Graph view | `graph` (Uses the _New tab view_ toolbar, if one is configured.) |

### Setting for Command items: Hide if not available

Enable this setting to hide the command item if the command cannot be performed in the current context. Disabled by default.

## Improvements üöÄ

- Gallery: All items that use `editor:*` commands added from the Gallery from now on will check availability by default (e.g., the _Bold_ item is not displayed in Reading mode).
  - Any items that have already been added to toolbars from the Gallery are not affected; use the command item's [advanced setting](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Command-items#hide-if-not-available) to use this behavior.
- Search results for toolbars and toolbar items now prioritize results that start with the given search string. _Thank you for the suggestion @dopairym_ via [#266](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/266).
- Search results in [Quick Tools](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Quick-Tools) now prioritize recently used items and toolbars.
- In the New tab view, the Position context menu options are now more appropriate, showing only "Top" or "Center" options, depending on whether you've opted to replace the view with a toolbar or not.
- Gallery: Items now use a little bit of color, and show a plus icon on hover.
- Settings: More specific help pages for each item type.

## Fixes üõ†Ô∏è

- Toolbars should now be rendered on workspace changes. [#94](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/94)
- Toolbars should now be rendered in all visible views/leaves on Obsidian startup. [#94](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/94) [#242](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/242) [#303](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/303) _Thank you @FelipeRearden, @Moyf, and @usernotnull_
- Command items that do not exist, or are not available, are now no longer shown in menus, including the floating button.
- When hovering over items in menus the hover color is now explicitly set, to fix case where it was not showing on tablets with pointer devices. [#233](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/233#discussioncomment-13574855) _Thanks @MatejCharbusky_ 
- Recent files, items, and toolbars lists are now stored in local storage, versus in settings, as they were causing too many settings file updates and synchronization issues. [#348](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/348) _Thank you @Karreg_
- Available plugins are now updated on display of the item modal.
- `package.json` was using the incorrect license version. Updated to `GPL-3.0`.
- Settings: The toolbar settings modal title is now updated when the toolbar's name is changed.
- Settings: You were previously unable to remove the _New tab_ toolbar setting, if you already had it set.
- Settings: Blue Topaz theme: Removed extra item type menu padding for toolbar items.
- Help: The title now appears in light mode.
- What's New (release notes): The language code was not being displayed in the content of fetch error messages; it displayed the wrong URL.

## API

A new **Menu API** allows you to dynamically create menus that contain commands, files, or URIs, each with optional icons:

```ts
await ntb.menu([
  { type: 'command', value: 'editor:toggle-bold', label: 'Bold', icon: 'bold' },
  { type: 'file', value: 'Home.md', label: 'Open File' },
  { type: 'uri', value: 'https://example.com', label: 'Visit Site' }
]);
```

[Check out the API documentation](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Note-Toolbar-API#menu).
