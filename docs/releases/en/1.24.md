What's new in Note Toolbar v1.24?

## New Features 🎉

### Replace the New tab view with a toolbar

Under the **New tab view** section in settings, select a toolbar and enable **Replace view with toolbar**.

The [Launchpad](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/New-tab-view) is an experimental feature to show a toolbar as a replacement for the _New tab_ view. It's actually live right now in `1.23.05` or later, because I need your feedback!

Try it out:

⚠️ Note: If you've previously tried the Launchpad, remove the `note-toolbar-launchpad` custom class from your toolbar.

1. In Note Toolbar's settings, go to **New tab view** and select **New tab toolbar**.
2. Enable the **Replace view with toolbar** setting. 

Look for the _New tab view (Launchpad)_ in the Style Settings plugin to customize color, columns, sizing, and more.

Please [read this page](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/New-tab-view) and [let me know your feedback](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/341)!

### Toolbars in Bases

Show your toolbars in [Bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases), "a new core plugin that lets you turn any set of notes into a powerful database. With Bases you can organize everything from projects to travel plans, reading lists, and more."

Enable under **File types and views → Bases**.

> [!note]
> This option may change depending on how this Catalyst feature evolves. 

### Toolbars in other file types

Enable under **File types and views → Other data types**. Type in the name of a data type (e.g., `excalidraw`).

- This is _not_ the same as the file's extension. (e.g., Excalidraw files have a `.md` file extension.)
- This uses the **data type**, which can be found by:
  - inspecting the editor when you have a file open, and
  - searching for the `data-type` attribute.
- Let me know if you need help trying to figure this out for a given plugin or file type. 
- _Thank you for the suggestion @BlitzVI_ via [#314](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/314).

| For this plugin/view... | ...enter this data type |
| --- | --- |
| Excalidraw | `excalidraw` |
| Graph view | `graph` (Uses the _New tab view_ toolbar, if one is configured.) |

### Setting for Command items: Hide if not available

Enable this setting to hide the command item if the command cannot be performed in the current context. Disabled by default.

## Improvements 🚀

- Search results for toolbars and toolbar items now prioritize results that start with the given search string. _Thank you for the suggestion @dopairym_ via [#266](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/266).
- Search results in [Quick Tools](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Quick-Tools) now prioritize recently used items and toolbars.
- In the New tab view, the Position context menu options are now more appropriate, showing only "Top" or "Center" options, depending on whether you've opted to replace the view with a toolbar or not.
- Gallery: Items now use a little bit of color, and show a plus icon on hover.
- Settings: More specific help pages for each item type.

## Fixes

- Toolbars should now be rendered on workspace changes. [#94](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/94)
- Toolbars should now be rendered in all visible views/leaves on Obsidian startup. [#94](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/94) [#242](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/242) [#303](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/303) _Thank you @FelipeRearden, @Moyf, and @usernotnull_
- Recent files, items, and toolbars lists are now stored in local storage, versus in settings, as they were causing too many settings file updates and synchronization issues. [#348](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/348) _Thank you @Karreg_
- Available plugins are now updated on display of the item modal.
- `package.json` was using the incorrect license version. Updated to `GPL-3.0`.
- Settings: You were previously unable to remove the _New tab_ toolbar setting, if you already had it set.
- Help: The title now appears in light mode.
- What's New (release notes): The language code was not being displayed in the content of fetch error messages; it displayed the wrong URL.
