What's new in Note Toolbar v1.22?

## New Features ðŸŽ‰

### Open files and URIs (if they're files) in non-editable modals

When configuring a File or URI type item, look for the _Where to open file(s)..._ option.

Notes: 

- URIs can also be opened in new tabs, split view, a new window, or modals, as long as they resolve to files.
- Other file types, excluding PDFs (hopefully, for now) can also be opened. Upon opening, the modal attempts to wrap the filename as an embedded wiki link, and display it.
- _Note that I'm also investigating getting modals to be editable, but I may ultimately have to rely on another plugin (like Modal Opener). Thanks @Moyf for the suggestion._

### Toolbars work in Kanban boards

Enable in _File types and views â†’ Kanban boards_.

## Improvements ðŸš€

- Gallery: Added **Backup Note Toolbar config**, which makes a copy of Note Toolbar's `data.json` into your vault. Modify the script if you want to change its output location.
- Gallery: Added **Open file in new tab**, which allows you to select a file that then opens in a new tab. _Useful on mobile!_
- _Move item to toolbar_  is now _**Copy item to toolbar**_. This lets you create a toolbar with items that you can re-use across toolbars.
- Toolbar usage is now shown in the toolbar delete confirmation window.
- File fields, such as the selector for File type items, now shows the most recently opened files in the vault first.
- _What's New_ notes are now fetched from the Note Toolbar repository, so they can be updated without needing to make a new release.
- Updated Ukrainian translations. _Thanks @laktiv!_
- Added a Note Toolbar â†’ Other â†’ **Debugging** setting which, when enabled, outputs messages to the console. This might be useful for developers or when troubleshooting issues.

## API Beta

Added `ntb.fileSuggester()` which lets you prompt for a file, for a folder, or for any file in your vault (default). [See the documentation.](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Note-Toolbar-API#filesuggester)

## Fixes

### Toolbar queries should be more reliable

Fundamental change to the way the plugin searches for existing toolbars and updates/deletes them, using `getActiveViewOfType()`:

- This should mean toolbars should _not_ display more than once, as it was in some cases. [#263](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/263) [#271](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/271)
- This should hopefully also mean toolbars work as expected when using other plugins, including Hover Editor ([#14](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/14)) and Modal Opener ([#217](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/217)).

### Other fixes

- Variables that use number properties were not working. [#322](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/322) _Thanks @Moyf!_
- Certain toolbar items that resolved as empty, or werenâ€™t visible, were still taking up space in the toolbar. (In at least one case, you couldn't move past that item using the Focus command / keyboard controls.)
- Mobile: Border on toolbar in bottom position was not appearing on left + right sides; it does now.
- Mobile: Border style was not applying to FABs; it is now. Color is now in interactive color (Obsidian purple by default).
- Settings: JS items added from Search not immediately appearing in item list. _Thanks @Moyf_ [#311](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/311)
- Settings: Icon select modal now defaults to the previously selected icon for that item.
- Page preview now no longer shows if the item is a folder (versus a file).
- Templater items: The Template file selector no longer shows folders that _begin_ with the template folder path; only those that match it.
