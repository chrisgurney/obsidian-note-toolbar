What's new in Note Toolbar v1.22?

## New Features ðŸŽ‰

### Open files and URIs (if they're files) in non-editable modals

When configuring a File or URI type item, look for the _Where to open file(s)..._ option.

Notes: 

- URIs can also be opened in new tabs, split view, a new window, or modals, as long as they resolve to files.
- Other file types, excluding PDFs (hopefully, for now) can also be opened. Upon opening, the modal attempts to wrap the filename as an embedded wiki link, and display it.
- _Note that I'm also investigating getting modals to be editable, but I may ultimately have to rely on another plugin (like Modal Opener). Thanks @Moyf for the suggestion._

### Toolbars work in Kanban boards

Enable in _File types and views â†’ Kanban boards_.

## Improvements ðŸš€

- Gallery: Added: `Open file in new tab`, which allows you to select a file that then opens in a new tab. Very useful on mobile.
- Toolbar usage is now shown in the toolbar delete confirmation window.

## API Beta

Added `ntb.fileSuggester()` which lets you prompt for a file, for a folder, or for any file in your vault (default).

## Fixes

### Toolbar queries now using getActiveViewOfType()

This was the main reason for releasing this as a beta, as it's a fundamental change to the way the plugin searched for existing toolbars and updated/deleted them.

- This should mean toolbars should _not_ display more than once, as it was in some cases.
- This should hopefully also mean toolbars work as expected when using other plugins, including: Hover Editor, and Modal Opener.

### Other fixes

- Mobile: Border style not applying to FABs + Color is now in interactive color (Obsidian purple by default).
- Settings: JS items added from Search not immediately appearing in item list. _Thanks @Moyf_ #311
- Settings: Icon select modal now defaults to the previously selected icon for that item.
- Page preview now no longer shows if the item is a folder (versus a file).
