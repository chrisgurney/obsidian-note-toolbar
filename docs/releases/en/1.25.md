What's new in Note Toolbar v1.25?

## New Features ðŸŽ‰

## Improvements ðŸš€

- Quick Tools: When clicking, hold down `âŒ˜ + shift` (on MacOS) / `ctrl + shift` (on Windows) to open the item for editing, versus executing the item.
  - Note: Duplicates (same label, or tooltip if there's no label, and link or command ID) are not shown in the Quick Tools list. So if you edit an item and change the label (or tooltip if not shown), you will create a new unique entry in the Quick Tools list. 
  - _Thank you @Moyf for the suggestion! [#360](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/360)_
- Under **Advanced script settings**, ssript items (i.e., Dataview, JavaScript, JS Engine, Templater) have a **Focus in editor** option that defaults to `true`: After scripts are executed, the focus is placed in the editor; if set to `false`, it won't be.

## API

### ntb.menu()

Now has an optional `focusInMenu` parameter that, when set to `true`, will set focus in the menu when it's opened. This is useful for keyboard accessibility. The default is `false`.

Pair this with disabling the above **Focus in editor** setting to leave focus in the menu that appears.

_Thank you @FelipeRearden for identifying the [issue](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/233#discussioncomment-13583653)._
