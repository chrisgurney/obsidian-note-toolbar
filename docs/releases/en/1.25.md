What's new in Note Toolbar v1.25?

## Improvements ðŸš€

- You can now press `ctrl`/`cmd` + `enter` to close the Item or Style modal. _Thanks @rayzer-hu for the suggestion!_ #370
- Quick Tools: When clicking, hold down `âŒ˜ + shift` (on MacOS) / `ctrl + shift` (on Windows) to open the item for editing, versus executing the item.
  - Note: Duplicates (same label, or tooltip if there's no label, and link or command ID) are not shown in the Quick Tools list. So if you edit an item and change the label (or tooltip if not shown), you will create a new unique entry in the Quick Tools list. 
  - _Thank you @Moyf for the suggestion! [#360](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/360)_
- Script items (i.e., Dataview, JavaScript, JS Engine, Templater) now have a **Focus in editor** option (under **Advanced settings**) that defaults to `true`: After a script is executed, focus is placed in the editor; if set to `false`, it won't be.
- Script items: The **Output callout ID** option has been moved into the **Advanced settings** section.

## Fixes

- Quick Tools: Duplicate command items were appearing if `link` text was different; command items are now de-duplicated based on command ID (in addition to its text, i.e., label with a tooltip fallback).
- Some CSS rules applied by certain themes (e.g., Velocity, Primary) are now reset. #378 _Thanks @middleblazer9i
 for originally reporting [this issue](https://github.com/Gonzalo-D-Sales/obsidian-velocity/issues/71)._
- Localization resources are now garbage-collected when the plugin is unloaded. _Thanks @kotaindah55 for the fix!_ #371

## API

### ntb.menu() focusInMenu option

The [ntb.menu](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Note-Toolbar-API#menu) API has an optional `focusInMenu` parameter that, when set to `true`, will set focus in the menu when it's opened. This is useful for keyboard accessibility. The default is `false`.

Use this with disabling the **Focus in editor** setting to leave focus in the menu that appears (instead of focussing in the editor).

```ts
await ntb.menu([
  { type: 'command', value: 'editor:toggle-bold', label: 'Toggle Bold', icon: 'bold' },
  // ... other menu items go here
], { focusInMenu: true });
```

_Thank you @FelipeRearden for identifying the [accessibility issue](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/233#discussioncomment-13583653)._
