What's new in Note Toolbar v1.28?

_Make sure you've updated to the latest version to get all of these changes._

## New Features 🎉

### Limit item visibility to Reading and Editing mode

Choose whether items should appear only in Reading mode, Editing mode, or both (default).

### Create flexible gaps in your toolbar with Spreaders

Use a **Spreader** (↔) in your toolbar to push apart groups of items, to the edges of the editor. This allows you to place groups of items on the left side, and on the right side of the editor, for example.

- To add a Spreader, in your toolbar's settings, use the (↔) button below the item list, or search for "Spreader" when adding a new item.
- For toolbars in the `Bottom` position, you may also need to add the `editor width` style.

## Improvements 🚀

### More intuitive visibility controls

- Settings: Toggle platform visibility with one click, instead of having to turn icons and labels off first.
- Settings: Item visibiliity states now use icons only to represent what's visible and what's not, to conserve space.

### Other improvements

- Settings: Breaks and Separators can now be found by searching in the "Add item" modal.

## Fixes 🛠️

- `v1.28.04` Mobile: The `editor width` style was not available when the toolbar was in the `Bottom` position.
- Toolbars were not being completely hidden if there were no visible items. _Thanks @moyf!_
- Toolbars in the `Below properties` position may fail to render in Preview mode because the properties hasn't been rendered yet. [#464](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/464) _Thank you @BluFaze!_
