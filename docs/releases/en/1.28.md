What's new in Note Toolbar v1.28?

_Make sure you've updated to the latest version to get all of these changes._

## New Features 🎉

### Limit item visibility to Reading and Editing mode

Choose whether items should appear only in Reading mode, Editing mode, or both (default).

### Create flexible gaps in your toolbar with Spreaders

Use a **Spreader** (↔) in your toolbar to push apart groups of items, to the edges of the editor. This allows you to place groups of items on the left side, and on the right side of the editor, for example.

- To add a Spreader, in your toolbar's settings, use the (↔) button below the item list, or search for "Spreader" when adding a new item.
- For toolbars in the `Bottom` position, you may also need to add the `editor width` style.
- Add it to a [Note Toolbar Callout](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Note-Toolbar-Callouts) using a data element on its own line: `> - <data data-spread/>`
- _Thanks to @usernotnull [for the idea](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/302)!_

### Callout "Card" style

<img width="700" alt="Demostration of card style for Note Toolbar Callouts" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1f95d5b-d5b7-4f09-a16a-5e5f0b4dfd0c" />

Create a [Note Toolbar Callout](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Note-Toolbar-Callouts), using the `card` style to create a larger format toolbar. This can be helpful for "navigation" notes, such as a home dashboard.

- The [Iconize plugin](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-iconize) is required to add icons.
- Control the width and number of cards with these CSS variables in a snippet:
  - desktop and mobile: `--ntb-callout-card-width` and `--ntb-callout-card-flex`
  - mobile override: `--ntb-callout-card-width-mobile` and `--ntb-callout-card-flex-mobile`
- Add the `nowrap` or `mnwrp` (for mobile only) style to have the cards horizontally scrollable, as shown in the screenshot.
- Change the color of icons via the callout metadata. Supported: `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `cyan`, `blue`, `purple`, `pink`
- _Feedback would be appreciated!_

For example, this shows three cards across a note (in the Default theme, with default settings), with blue icons:

```markdown
> [!note-toolbar|card-blue]
> - [[Home.md|:LiHome: Home]]
> - [:LiGlobe: Website](<https://google.com/>)
> - [:LiCalendar1: Today]()<data data-ntb-command="daily-notes"/>
```

Add more cards and make them scroll (as shown in the screenshot):

```markdown
> [!note-toolbar|card-green-nowrap]
> - [[Welcome To The Vault.md|:LiHome: Home]]
> - [:LiGlobe: Google](<https://chrisgurney.ca/>)
> - [:LiCalendar1: Today]()<data data-ntb-command="daily-notes"/>
> - [[Meetings.md|:LiPhone: Meetings]]
> - [[Creative.md|:LiPalette: Creative work]]
```

Here's an example of a [Dataview JS script](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/499) that shows your bookmarks as a scrollable list of cards.

_Thank you for the suggestion, received via the [Google feedback form ↗](https://forms.gle/sa75KNAQiWTtAY4P8)._

### Select a specific toolbar from the Navigation bar's Ribbon button

Under the **Toolbars within the app → Navigation bar** setting you can now also select a specific toolbar to display. _Thank you @Xto-tt0 for [the suggestion](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/493)!_

## Improvements 🚀

### More intuitive visibility controls

- Settings: Toggle platform visibility with one click, instead of having to turn icons and labels off first.
- Settings: Item visibiliity states now use icons only to represent what's visible and what's not, to conserve space.

### Other improvements

- `v1.28.12` Item search: Create new items from search, if there's no applicable results (not just no _visible_ results).
- `v1.28.12` Settings UX: Better scrolling to newly created items; added "Create..." links to empty states.
- `v1.28.09` Settings: Navbar visibility button shows the Navbar's current state.
- `v1.28.07` Settings: Sub-settings in the _Toolbars within the app_ section are now visually indented.
- `v1.28.06` Cupertino theme: Item menus now have the glassy effect. _Thank you FREYA on Discord!_
- `v1.28.05` Tablets: Item menus now also get the `glass` style applied.
- Settings: Breaks and Separators can now be found by searching in the "Add item" modal.

## Fixes 🛠️

- `v1.28.12` Item search: Item breaks/separators/spreaders now only show if they match search results.
- `v1.28.12` Settings: Keyboard focus was not visible after tabbing away from a toggle control. [#501](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/501)
- `v1.28.09` Items set to hide on desktop were taking up room in toolbars on mobile, even if they were also set to hide on mobile.
- `v1.28.07` Removed padding above Obsidian's non-floating top navigation, when the toolbar's in the `Top (fixed)` position.
- `v1.28.05` [Tab file items](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Styling-toolbars): Active items with the `button` or `glass` style should no longer have an underline.
- `v1.28.05` Baseline + Cupertino themes: Item backgrounds should now be blurred again.
- `v1.28.04` Mobile: The `editor width` style is now available when the toolbar is in the `Bottom` position.
- Toolbars were not being completely hidden if there were no visible items. _Thanks @moyf!_
- Toolbars in the `Below properties` position may fail to render in Preview mode because the properties hasn't been rendered yet. [#464](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues/464) _Thank you @BluFaze!_
