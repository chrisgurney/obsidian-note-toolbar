What's new in Note Toolbar v1.28?

_Make sure you've updated to the latest version to get all of these changes._

## New Features 🎉

### Limit item visibility to Reading and Editing mode

Choose whether items should appear only in Reading mode, Editing mode, or both (default).

## Improvements 🚀

### Item visibility

- Settings: Item visibiliity states now use icons only to represent what's visible and what's not, to conserve space.
- Settings: Toggle platform visibility with one click, instead of having to turn both icons and labels off/on.
- Settings: Item visibility setting options should be more intuitive and consistent with one another.
