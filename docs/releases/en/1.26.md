What's new in Note Toolbar v1.26?

_Make sure you've updated to the latest version to get all of these changes._

## New Features 🎉

### Text toolbars

Have an existing toolbar appear when text is selected. Choose a toolbar in settings: **Toolbar locations → Text toolbar**

- Right-click on the toolbar (long-press on mobile) to change its settings.
- Some of the toolbar's styles (e.g., borders) are applied; others won't have an affect (e.g., sticky).
- Use [Style Settings ↗](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings/tree/main) to further customize: item colors + sizes, border colors + radius, and the toolbar's shadow.
- The command `Note Toolbar: Focus in text toolbar`:
  - puts keyboard focus in the text toolbar; OR
  - shows the text toolbar at the current cursor position, and places focus in it, if it's not already on screen.

### Tab bar position

Select the *Tab bar* position to put the toolbar at the top of the editor, next to the _Reading/Preview mode_ and _File menu_ buttons.

- Right-click on the button (long-press on mobile) to change its settings.
- Change the icon shown under Note Toolbar's settings: **Other → Icon**.

_Thank you @Dopairym for [the suggestion](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/379)!_

## Improvements 🚀

- If the **Disable if not available** advanced option is set for a toolbar item, and the item is unavailable -- or if the item's command is not available -- it is now disabled, instead of being completely hidden.
  - These items will still be completely hidden in menus.
  - For example, use this to set the _Bold_ command as disabled when in the _Reading_ view.
  - _Thank you @alexey-zaharchenko for [suggesting this behavior](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/386) in the first place._

## Fixes 🛠️

- Style menu options should now be alphabetized, regardless of language.
- When the toolbar was placed at the top position, Obsidian's header (displaying the filename and buttons) kept getting squished; it should now retain its minimum height.
- Gallery updates for [Obsidian 1.10.3 ↗](https://obsidian.md/changelog/2025-11-11-desktop-v1.10.3/):
  - Removed light/dark mode items that used commands no longer available.
  - Updated toggle light/dark item to use new Toggle light/dark command.
  - Updated items to use new Indent / Unindent commands that are available on all platforms.
