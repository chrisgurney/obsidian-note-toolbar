Select the *Tab bar* position to put the toolbar at the top of the editor, next to the _Reading/Preview mode_ and _File_ menu buttons.

- Right-click on the button to change its settings.
- Change the icon shown under Note Toolbar's settings: _Other > Icon_.

## Fixes üõ†Ô∏è

- When the toolbar was placed at the top position, Obsidian's header (displaying the filename and buttons) kept getting squished; it should now retain its minimum height.
