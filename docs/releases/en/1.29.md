What's new in Note Toolbar v1.29?

_Make sure you've updated to the latest version to get all of these changes._

## New Features 🎉

The Help view is now shown on first startup of the plugin. Cards at the top link to a new [Getting Started article](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/blob/master/docs/tips/en/getting-started.md), and to the Gallery.

### Default toolbar

You can now optionally set a Default toolbar that applies to all notes. The setting is at the top of the **Display rules** section.

- You will be asked after creating your first toolbar if you wish to set it as the Default.
- Mapping `*` to a toolbar still does the same thing, so existing mappings will continue to work.

### Visibility indicators

If an item is not visible on the current platform or mode, and indicator will appear next to the item in the toolbar's item list.

- When that item is opened, the applicable visibility setting will also be highlighted.
- If a note is not open in Reading or Editing mode, mode visibility is not highlighted.

## Improvements 🚀

### Settings

- All new toolbars now have a default name of `Toolbar`, rather than leaving the field empty.
- Warning is shown if the toolbar being deleted is an app toolbar (such as the _Text selection_ toolbar).
- Help section: Moved the _What’s new_ button to a link, so the section now takes up less room on smaller screens.
- Some toolbar list options weren’t applicable if the toolbar was empty, so they’re now hidden.
- Gallery: The toolbar suggester is skipped on adding an item, if there aren't any existing toolbars.

## Fixes 🛠️

Settings:

- Toolbar button alignment + item wrapping issues on phones.
- Toolbar list controls were taking up too much room on phones.
- Phone: Item + Mapping New/Search buttons should now be larger (full width).

## API

### `ntb.export()`

This function exports the given toolbar as a [Note Toolbar callout](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Note-Toolbar-Callouts). ([See the documentation.](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Note-Toolbar-API#export))

- This was an existing function (under `Toolbar`) that has been moved under `ntb`.
- This change was required as `ntb.getToolbars()` was not working from the new [Obsidian CLI ↗](https://help.obsidian.md/cli).

> [!important]
> This is a breaking change: Instead of calling `toolbar.export()`, use `ntb.export(toolbar)`.
