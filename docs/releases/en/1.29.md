What's new in Note Toolbar v1.29?

_Make sure you've updated to the latest version to get all of these changes._

## New Features 🎉

### Visibility indicators

If an item is not visible on the current platform or mode, and indicator will appear next to the item in the toolbar's item list.

- When that item is opened, the applicable visibility setting will also be highlighted.
- If a note is not open in Reading or Editing mode, mode visibility is not highlighted.

## Fixes 🛠️

Settings UX improvements:

- Toolbar button alignment + item wrapping issues on phones.
- Toolbar list controls were taking up too much room on phones.
- Help section buttons not wrapping on smaller screens.
- Phone: Item + Mapping New/Search buttons should be full width.

## API

### `ntb.export()`

This function exports the given toolbar as a [Note Toolbar callout](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Note-Toolbar-Callouts). ([See the documentation.](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Note-Toolbar-API#export))

- This was an existing function (under `Toolbar`) that has been moved under `ntb`.
- This change was required as `ntb.getToolbars()` was not working from the new [Obsidian CLI ↗](https://help.obsidian.md/cli).

> [!important]
> This is a breaking change: Instead of calling `toolbar.export()`, use `ntb.export(toolbar)`.
