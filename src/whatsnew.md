## New Features ðŸŽ‰

Adds a new Help window in settings, to point users to documentation, support, and feedback.

Adds toolbars to the file menu.
- When right-clicking on an internal link, the toolbar is for the linked note.
- On desktop the items are within a sub-menu that shows the toolbar's name (next to Note Toolbar's icon).
- On mobile the items are added directly to the menu.
- _Thanks to @imeed166 for the idea!_
