## v1.13

## New Features ðŸŽ‰

Adds the _What's New_ window in settings (you're looking at it), to provide highlights of the latest features in Note Toolbar.

Adds a new _Help_ window in settings, to point users to documentation, support, and feedback.

Adds toolbars to the file menu.
- When right-clicking on an internal link, the toolbar is for the linked note.
- On desktop the items are within a sub-menu that shows the toolbar's name (next to Note Toolbar's icon).
- On mobile the items are added directly to the menu.
- _Thanks to @imeed166 for the idea!_

## Improvements ðŸŽ‰

On desktop, sub-menu (i.e., Menu items within menus) are displayed using Obsidian's sub-menu UI, opening to the side of the menu instead of in place.
