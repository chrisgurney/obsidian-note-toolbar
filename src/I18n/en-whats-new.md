# v1.14 - Share your toolbars with other users!

## Copy toolbars to markdown

Right-click on a toolbar to see the _Copy to markdown_ option, or use the export icon in the toolbar’s settings, just above the item list.

- Markdown will be copied to the clipboard.
- Icons are output only if the [Iconize](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-iconize) plugin is installed and enabled.
- Be sure to read about [how exporting works](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Importing-and-exporting) and what's supported.

## Other improvements

- Most plugin startup tasks are now done after the layout's ready, and after initial toolbar rendering, which may help with performance. `#ObsidianOctober`
- An error message is now shown if a [Note Toolbar URI](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Note-Toolbar-URIs) contains invalid parameters.
- Fixed: Toolbar icons/text weren't being vertically centered by a few pixels, due to a line-height being added.
