What's new in Note Toolbar v1.18?

## New Features ðŸŽ‰

### Show a toolbar in the New tab view

Go to **Settings â†’ Display rules â†’ Show toolbar in New tab view** then select a toolbar to display in the _New tab_ view.

Notes:

- Any references to files or properties in variables or script commands won't work.
- If the toolbar is in the `Below Properties` position, it will be shown at the top instead.
- Supports the [Home Tab â†—](https://github.com/olrenso/obsidian-home-tab) and [Beautitab â†—](https://github.com/andrewmcgivery/obsidian-beautitab) plugins.

_Thank you @mardybardy for the idea in [#78](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/78)._

### Commands for individual toolbars

For fast access to a specific toolbar, open any toolbar's settings, and enable **Add toolbar command**.

A new command will be added (`Note Toolbar: Open: YOURTOOLBARNAME`) that will let you open that toolbar in a [Quick Tools window](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Quick-Tools).

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: Assign a hot key to that command for convenient access to that toolbar.

_Thank you Hydra (on the Obsidian Discord) for the idea._
