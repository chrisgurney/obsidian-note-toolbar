What's new in Note Toolbar v1.17?

## New Feature ðŸŽ‰

### Bottom toolbar position

By popular demand, there is now a Bottom toolbar position, which floats the toolbar at the bottom of your note.

- Set the position using _right-click â†’ Set position â†’ Bottom_, or via the toolbar's settings.
- Styling:
  - By default the toolbar is centered and only uses as much room as needed. If you would like it wider, or want to align it, try the `editor width` style (then you can use `left align` or `right align`).
  - If the `border` style is enabled, the border surrounds the toolbar.
- Adjust position and border radius using [Style Settings](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Style-Settings-plugin-support).
