# v1.13

## New Features 🎉

There is now a _What's New_ window available in settings (you're looking at it), to provide highlights of the latest features in Note Toolbar. This window is displayed once, when accessing the plugin's settings.

Added a new _Help_ window also available in settings, to point users to documentation, support, and to a new, easy-to-use [feedback form](https://forms.gle/2C38u9F8xTrutB1q8).

Access your toolbars from the file menu:
- When right-clicking on an internal link, the toolbar for the linked note is displayed.
- On desktop, the items are within a sub-menu that shows the toolbar's name (next to Note Toolbar's icon).
- On mobile, the items are added directly to the menu.
- _Thanks to @imeed166 for the idea!_

## Improvements 🎉

On desktop, Menu items within menus are displayed using Obsidian's sub-menu UI, opening to the side of the menu instead of in place.
