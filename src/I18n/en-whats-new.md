What's new in Note Toolbar v1.21?

## New Features ðŸŽ‰

### Introducing the Note Toolbar Gallery

The gallery is a curated list of items that can be added to your toolbars in just one (or two) clicks.

Most of the items are from the User Guide's _Examples_ page. However, the Gallery can include _even more_ as items can use scripts, creating useful tools that Obsidian does not provide out of the box. There's 66 items so far, but I'm aiming for a higher number on release.

Explore via the new **Gallery** button in settings, or if you have the beta open [open the Gallery here](obsidian://note-toolbar?gallery).

- Browse though the categories, or search for items at the top.
- To add an item to a toolbar, just click/tap on it. You will be prompted to select a toolbar to add it to.
- If the item is compatible with more than one plugin, you will be prompted to select the one you would like to use.

**I'd love your feedback!**

Iâ€™d love to hear your feedback on the items, and categories Iâ€™ve started this with. What are some helpful items you think other users would benefit from, that Obsidian doesnâ€™t already provide, or is maybe not obvious? And let me know if anythingâ€™s broken.

Note for the localization team: Strings used within the Gallery and its items are in the [`gallery.json`](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/blob/master/src/Gallery/gallery.json) and [`items.json`](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/blob/master/src/Gallery/items.json) files respectively.  

### Search for items to add 

Next to the `Add` button for the toolbar, you can now Search for items to add from your existing toolbars. 

Suggestions from the Gallery are provided at the bottom of search results.

## Improvements ðŸš€

- On phones: Items opened or added in settings now use the item modal, rather than expanding in the list in-place.
- JS Engine: Added an Evaluate function, which evaluates a provided expression and displays a value if returned.

## Fixes

- Toolbar Settings: The need to re-enable the Scripting setting if a plugin was not installed/enabled, and it was then installed and enabled, has been removed.
- Quick Tools: Console errors are no longer reported for any items.
- Settings: Hot key display logic has been updated thanks to @mProjectsCode â€™s updates.
- Item Settings: (To test) Style dropdown not rounded when itâ€™s actively being pressed down on phone.
- Item Settings: Fixed an issue where the command suggester field was empty, even though the command was valid.
