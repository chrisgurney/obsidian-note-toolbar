What's new in Note Toolbar v1.17?

## New Features ðŸŽ‰

### Bottom toolbar position

By popular demand, there is now a _Bottom_ toolbar position, which floats the toolbar at the bottom of your note.

Change to this position using _right-click â†’ Set position â†’ Bottom_, or via the toolbar's settings.

Styling notes:
- If the `border` style is enabled, the border surrounds the toolbar.
- Adjust distance from the bottom, left/right padding, and border radius using [Style Settings](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Style-Settings-plugin-support).

Limitations / Known issues:
1. Toolbars with breaks have a gap on the right side (equivalent to the size of the wrapped items).
2. Bottom toolbars + Floating buttons: On mobile, the built-in toolbar disappearing makes it hard to use certain toolbar items (e.g., select text â†’ bold).
    - As a bit of a workaround, consider adding the new `Note Toolbar: Open Quick Tools (for current toolbar)` to the editor toolbar: _Settings â†’ Toolbar â†’ scroll to the bottom of Manage toolbar options â†’ Add global command_

**ðŸ’¬ Let me know how well it works for you** in the [discussion thread](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/218), or use the [Google feedback form â†—](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeVWHVnookJr8HVQywk5TwupU-p7vkRkSt83Q5jscR6VwpZEQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).

### Quickly access styles from the toolbar's context menu

Get to the Style section of settings for the active toolbar by right-clicking on it (or long-press on mobile) and select _Style..._

### New command: Access Quick Tools for the current toolbar

Use the new `Note Toolbar: Open Quick Tools (for current toolbar)` command to open a [Quick Tools](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Quick-Tools) window that shows the items in the toolbar associated with the current note.

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: On mobile, consider adding this command to the editor toolbar: _Settings â†’ Toolbar â†’ scroll to the bottom of Manage toolbar options â†’ Add global command_

## Improvements ðŸš€

- New plugin setting: _Show toolbar for the linked note in the File menu_, under _Note Toolbar Settings â†’ Other_, which is defaulted to off. Allows you to selectively enable this feature, which was introduced in [`1.13`](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/releases/tag/1.13). _Thanks @Moyf and @FelipeRearden_
- Floating buttons: Support for the `autohide` and `border` styles.
  - The border color defaults to the button's icon color, but can be overridden with [Style Settings](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Style-Settings-plugin-support).
- Additional [Style Settings](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Style-Settings-plugin-support):
  - Override the `autohide` style opacity for toolbars and buttons separately.
  - Inactive opacity settings for mobile and desktop are now separate.

## Fixes

- Toolbars in split views are now updated on leaf change, if its config was updated.

## API Beta: Updates

_Thanks @FelipeRearden for feedback and testing!_

### New Features ðŸŽ‰

- Added `ntb.modal()`. See [`1.17.1`](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/releases/tag/1.17.1)

### Improvements ðŸš€

- Prompt: All options are now passed via an optional `options` object parameter, with defaults for each:
  ```javascript
  let result = await ntb.prompt(options?: {
    default?: string,      // Optional default value for text field; if not provided, no default value is set
    label?: string,        // Optional text shown above the text field, rendered as markdown; default none
    large?: boolean,       // Set true if text box should be larger; if not provided, defaults to false
    placeholder?: string,  // Optional text inside text field; defaults to preset message
  });
  ```
- Suggester: Made function easier to use with optional `keys` (if not provided, returned value is the selected option), also via an optional `options` parameter:
  ```javascript
  let result = await ntb.suggester(
    values: string[] | ((value: T) => string),  // Array of strings representing the text that will be displayed for each item in the suggester prompt. This can also be a function that maps an item to its text representation. Rendered as markdown.
    keys?: T[],  // Optional array containing the keys of each item in the correct order. If not provided, values are returned on selection.
    options?: {
      placeholder?: string,  // shown in the input field; defaults to message
      limit?: number         // Optional limit of the number of items rendered at once (useful to improve performance when displaying large lists). Defaults to no limit.
    });
  ```
- Suggester values and Prompt label (`options.label`) are now rendered as markdown, so they can include markdown and things like Iconize icons.
- Prompt: Reduced size of modal when using the simple prompt, including on mobile.
- Prompt: When using the `large` option, a modifier key (e.g., `cmd`) and `enter` now submits.

### Changes

- The API class name has been shortened from `NoteToolbar` to `ntb`.
- CSS: Updated all class names from `note-toolbar-comp-*` to `note-toolbar-ui-*`; add `-ui` class for Suggester. _Thanks @FelipeRearden_
- Examples of the above in the repo have been updated:
  - For Dataview: [`NtbPrompt.js`](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/blob/master/examples/Scripts/Dataview/NtbPrompt.js) and [`NtbSuggester.js`](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/blob/master/examples/Scripts/Dataview/NtbSuggester.js)
  -   For JS Engine: [`NtbPrompt.js`](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/blob/master/examples/Scripts/JsEngine/NtbPrompt.js) and [`NtbSuggester.js`](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/blob/master/examples/Scripts/JsEngine/NtbSuggester.js)
