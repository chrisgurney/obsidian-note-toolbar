What's new in Note Toolbar v1.15?

## Scripting

Note Toolbar can now execute Dataview, JavaScript (via [JS Engine â†—](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=js-engine)), and Templater queries, expressions, and scripts from Note Toolbar buttons!

### What's supported?

If these plugins are installed and enabled you can:

- Dataview: Run queries, evaluate expressions, and execute scripts (like with `dv.view`).
- JS Engine: Execute scripts.
- Templater: Insert templates, and create new notes from templates.

If these generate output, they're output to the cursor position, or to a `note-toolbar-output` callout that you provide an ID for. 

### What's _not_ supported?

- Ability to share, copy as callout, or import callouts with script items.
- Ability to execute script items from callouts.

### Read the documentation ðŸ“–

- [User Guide](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Executing-scripts)
- [Example scripts](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/tree/master/examples/Scripts)

### Feedback wanted ðŸ’¬

I would really appreciate your questions or feedback in the [discussion thread](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/171), or in the [Google feedback form â†—](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeVWHVnookJr8HVQywk5TwupU-p7vkRkSt83Q5jscR6VwpZEQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).

1. Do your existing scripts work as expected? (If not, what changes did you have to make?)
2. Does configuration make sense? (Should I add or change anything?)
3. Try out the Note Toolbar Script components for output, and let me know what you think.
4. Does the documentation and help text make sense? (Should I add or change anything?)

_Thank you!_
