# v1.13

## New Features 🎉

Added the _What's New_ window in settings (you're looking at it), to provide highlights of the latest features in Note Toolbar.

Added a new _Help_ window in settings, to point users to documentation, support, and feedback.

Added toolbars to the file menu.
- When right-clicking on an internal link, the toolbar for the linked note is displayed.
- On desktop, the items are within a sub-menu that shows the toolbar's name (next to Note Toolbar's icon).
- On mobile, the items are added directly to the menu.
- _Thanks to @imeed166 for the idea!_

## Improvements 🎉
