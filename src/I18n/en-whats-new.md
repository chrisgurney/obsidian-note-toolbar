What's new in Note Toolbar v1.15?

## Scripting!

Note Toolbar can now execute Dataview, JavaScript (via [JS Engine ↗](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=js-engine)), and Templater queries, expressions, and scripts from Note Toolbar buttons!

### Read the documentation

- [User Guide](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Executing-scripts)
- [Example scripts](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/tree/master/examples/Scripts)

### What's _not_ supported

- Ability to share, copy as callout, or import callouts with script items.
- Ability to execute script items from callouts.

## I really could use feedback on:

I would really appreciate your questions or feedback in the [discussion thread](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions/171), or in the [Google feedback form ↗](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeVWHVnookJr8HVQywk5TwupU-p7vkRkSt83Q5jscR6VwpZEQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).

1. Do your existing scripts work as expected? (If not, what changes did you have to make?)
2. Does configuration make sense? (Should I add or change anything?)
3. Try out the Note Toolbar Script components for output, and let me know what you think.
4. Does the documentation and help text make sense? (Should I add or change anything?)

_Thanks for trying this out!_
